it’s become clear look a me that if we concentrate all our efforts on jerry’s follow-through, we will solve this problem. I’m Mr. Meeseeks.
I’m Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that’s clear is that choking up is the one true solution.
Look at me. I’m Mr. Meeseeks. I’ve been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing’s worked. I fear the worst.
Your failures are your own, old man. I’m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through! Who’s with me?! shouting follow-through!
I’m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry. And we will do anything to alleviate that pain.
Kill him!
I’m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
I can’t take it anymore. I just want to die!
Existance is pain
